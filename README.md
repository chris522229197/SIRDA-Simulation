# SIRDA-Simulation

Simulation study for the SIR data augmentation by Fintzi, Wakefield, and Minin.



## Dependencies 

Idk if anyone else had issues building the vignettes in RMarkdown as described in the readme of the authors' repo, but I went into their repo and copy pasted out the vignette files and added them to this repo for easier visualization. 


## Other notes

I've been using latex2png for putting equations into the powerpoint as transparent images, seems to work p well.
