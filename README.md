# SIRDA-Simulation

Simulation study for the SIR Bayesian data augmentation by Fintzi, Cui, Wakefield, and Minin (2017). 

## Instruction

To run the simulation, execute `Rscript simulate.R` with the command line parameters. To see details about the parameters, run `Rscript simulate.R --help`.

## Dependencies 

- R package `BDAepimodel` for fitting Bayesian data-augmented stochastic epidemic model as in Fintzi et al. (2017): run `install_github('fintzij/BDAepimodel')` to install the package. The code repository is https://github.com/fintzij/BDAepimodel.

## Other notes

I've been using latex2png for putting equations into the powerpoint as transparent images, seems to work p well.
